        let g:xmms_id3_encoding="gbk"

    Specify the play window's width:
        let g:xmms_window_width=30

    Specify the playlist format, default is "%artist - %title", %album
    is also avaiable.

Notes for MPD users
===================
    - There's only one playlist which MPD uses to play, users can only load
      other playlists' contents to that list. So the playlist name displayed
      in the status line is just the playlist's version number.
    - Currently, this plugin only support localhost mpd server.


Tips
====
    When adding music file or directory, you can use Ctrl-D to show all 
    candidates. Also, you can use arrow keys to navigate the history.
